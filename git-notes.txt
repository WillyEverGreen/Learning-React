✅ 1. git init
📦 Starts a new Git repository in your current folder.
It’s like telling Git:

“Hey, I want to start tracking this project.”

✅ 2. git branch -M main
🔀 Renames the current branch to main
(M replaces any old branch name like master)

“Let’s use main as the main branch name.”

✅ 3. git add .
➕ Adds all your files to Git's staging area.

“Prepare everything to be saved (committed).”

✅ 4. git commit -m "your message"
📝 Saves a snapshot of your code with a message.

“Save this version and describe what I did.”

✅ 5. git remote add origin <your-repo-URL>
🌐 Connects your local project to a remote GitHub repository.
Replace <your-repo-URL> with your actual GitHub repo link.
eg:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git 

✅ 6. git push origin main
🚀 Sends your code to GitHub.

“Push my local main branch to GitHub’s main branch.”
