1.   The package.json file is a core file in any Node.js project. It contains important metadata about the project and is used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, versioning, and more.


In easier terms:
 
📁 What is package.json?
Think of package.json as the ID card or instruction manual of your Node.js project. It tells:

what your project is called,

what tools it needs to work,

and what commands you can run.

🧩 Why is it useful?
Imagine you’re baking a cake:

You need a recipe → That’s like the scripts

You need ingredients → Those are your dependencies

You need to know what the cake is called, who made it, etc. → That’s the metadata (name, version, author),

2. package-lock.json
Main Purpose: It locks down the exact versions of every package and its dependencies in your project.

What It Does:

It guarantees that everyone who installs your project gets exactly the same versions of dependencies, even if new versions are released.

It records every package (including nested ones) with their exact version numbers.
